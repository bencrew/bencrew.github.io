									<h2>About Me</h2>
									<p>I graduated De Montfort University in 2016 with a Second class (upper) degree with honors, this included a one year placement working for a small software developer.  Prior to this I completed a two year access course at Leicester College receiving a triple grade distinction. Previously to this I was an assistant manager in a busy restaurant, on a track to becoming a manager however I didn’t feel passionate about this form of work so with a heavy heart at the age of twenty four I applied to the access course and began my studies. It was  a challenging six years and I have overcome many personal and professional changes. I have become a husband and father to two beautiful children, this commitment has lead to me becoming more committed to my work. This has however not dampened my passion for programming, development and also 3D modeling.</p>

								</section>
								<section>
									<h3><p>When: 2012 <br/>
										Tech:  C++, SFML <br/></h3>
										Description: This is a pontoon style game I made using SFML in C++. It is a single player or a 2 player game. I wrote all the logic for the computer when playing single player. The player has the ability to split hands, draw cards until bust and stick. The computer will draw until it gets 16 or higher then will stick. There are different levels of 21/pontoon i.e. blackjack, 5 card trick and normal 21.

										<h3>When: 2013 <br/>
										Tech: C++ SFML <br/></h3>
										Description: This is a space invaders game I made as my first year final project.  You shoot the aliens coming down the screen at you, if they reach the bottom the game ends and you get a high score. The shields will be destroyed if hit to many times.

									<h3>When: 2013 <br/>
									Tech: UDK game engine <br/></h3>
									Description: I made this as a part of a group project. The brief was to make a game based on a movie. We chose to a game based on the film Alien. This was a puzzle based game with jumping puzzles and collectibles. Throughout the game there are cut scenes, puzzles to solve and quick time events.

										<h3>When: 2014 <br/>
										Tech: C++, SFML <br/></h3>
										Description: This was a project to make a platform game made on the premise of “Dave the plumber”. The game featured enemies, collectibles, static/destroyable blocks and power ups. I used a basic physics model for the jumping and movement (Euler calculation).

									<h3>When: 2016 <br/>
									Tech: Android Studio <br/></h3>								
									<p>This Project was to implement a single tap game for use on a mobile device, the game was made using Android Studio. The game that was made was based on a group elevator pitch, the initial pitch was a single tap game whereby the user would have to get by waves on enemies that came towards the players ship at the bottom of the screen.  The user was able to maneuver the ship along the screen to dodge and shoot the enemies. The game concept used memes as its basis and built a story around this. </p>
									<p>The mechanics of the game involve the player using the touch screen to move the ship left and right across the screen. The difficulty begins fairly simply with only one enemy on the screen at a time, but for every five enemies that you survive another will spawn. The objective is to survive as many waves as possible and achieve a high score. The game features a start screen, a menu screen with a brief story, settings menu where the in game music can be controlled.

									<h3>When: 2016 <br/>
									Tech: C++, openGL, XML <br/></h3>		
									<p>This was a group project, where we had to make our own game engine and then create a game using the engine we had created. It was created from scratch using C++ and OpenGL.
									The engine the group created contained the following elements: 
									<li>Object loading (FBX)</li>
									<li>Texturing</li>
									<li>Ambient lighting</li>
									<li>Data driven XML loader</li>
									<li>NPC AI</li>
									<li>Collision physics</li>
									<li>Sound manager</li>

									I worked on object loading through XML parsing using tiny XML, every object was loaded into the scene through XML and all of an objects data would be loaded along with the model such as height, width, length and data to do with the type of object loading i.e. health or ammo. </br>
									I also wrote custom collision physics for the engine, this enabled the player to move around the world and interact with object within it. </br>
									A demo reel for the final game can be seen here.

									<h3>When: 2016 <br/>
									Tech: C#, Unity3D, Leap Motion<br/></h3>								
									<p>My final year project was to create a fully functioning fruit machine that could be controlled by using a contact-less controller. I also wrote a dissertation piece titled 
									"Fruit Machine using Leap Motion Controller" This looked at the evolution of the fruit machine and the possible innovation of the future. </br>
									The Fruit machine was controlled my using a touch-less piece of equipment called the <a href="https://www.leapmotion.com/"> <strong>Leap Motion</strong></a>, it tracks hand motions in real time and allows the user to control buttons in a virtual environment. </br>
									The fruit machine had the following features:
									<li>Checking for a win of 3 symbols on the center line</li>
									<li>Spinning and randomised stopping of the reels</li>
									<li>Chance of holding reels</li>
									<li>Chance of bonus game on a win</li>
									<li>Sound Effects</li>
									<li>All buttons pressed using contact-less controller</li>

									<h2 align="center">Paper less Kitchen</h2>
									<p align="center">									
									I am working on making a paperless kitchen using Windows forms and C#. The system requires the users to enter all important information such as fridge temperature checks and cooking temperatures. The data is submitted at the end of a session and stored in weekly Excel files, the system automatically detects the week number and dynamical creates a new file if needed. 
									</p>								
								</section>								
								<section>
									<h2 align="center">Game: Tip table</h2>
									<p align="center">
									One of two games I am currently working on, the game is a puzzle game being made in Unity 3D. </br>
									It is based on an old style tipping maze game where the user tips a platform forward and backwards, left and right to try and get a ball around a maze to a goal. The game will feature multiple levels getting harder each time. The time will be stored for each level giving the chance to beat your fastest times.
									</p>
								</section>
								<section>
									<h2 align="center">Game: Cat burglar</h2>
									<p align="center">
									The second game I am working on in my spare time, a cat burglar simulation RPG game. </br>
									The player must break into homes to gain money, the more money the better equipment can be purchased to break into more valuable houses. </br>
									Each house has several different points of entry depending on the skills the player decides to chose. Different skills will include 
									<li>Lock picking</li>
									<li>Silent Moment</li>
									<li>Hacking</li>
									<li>Glass cutting</li>
									<li>Climbing</li>
									Each skill will have its own mini game to complete to gain entry. The skills can be leveled up giving the ability to enter more lavish houses.
