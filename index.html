									<h2>About Me</h2>
									<p>I graduated De Montfort University in 2016 with a Second class (upper) degree with honors, this included a one year placement working for a small software developer.  Prior to this I completed a two year access course at Leicester College receiving a triple grade distinction. Previously to this I was an assistant manager in a busy restaurant, on a track to becoming a manager however I didn’t feel passionate about this form of work so with a heavy heart at the age of twenty four I applied to the access course and began my studies. It had been a challenging six years and I have overcome many personal and professional changes, I have become a husband and father to two beautiful children. Leading me to become more committed to my work. This has however not affected my passion for games programming, development and also 3D modeling.</p>

								<section>
									<p>When: 2012 <br/>
										Tech:  C++, SFML <br/>
										Description: This is a pontoon style game I made using SFML in C++. It is a single player or a 2 player game. I wrote all the logic for the computer when playing single player. The player has the ability to split hands, draw cards until bust and stick. The computer will draw until it gets 16 or higher then will stick. There are different levels of 21/pontoon i.e. blackjack, 5 card trick and normal 21.

										Description: This is a space invaders game I made as my first year final project.  You shoot the aliens coming down the screen at you, if they reach the bottom the game ends and you get a high score. The shields will be destroyed if hit to many times.

										Tech: C++, SFML <br/>
										Description: This was a project to make a platform game mad on the premise of “Dave the plumber”. The game featured enemies, collectables, static/destroyable blocks and power ups. I used a basic physics model for the jumping (Euler calculation).
